## About Me

I’m currently working on building modern UI/UX websites and full-stack projects.

I’m looking to collaborate on innovative web applications, front-end development, and software engineering projects.

I’m seeking help with scalable application architecture, advanced React patterns, performance optimization in Python & C++, and cloud-native deployment strategies (CI/CD, Docker, 
Kubernetes, AWS/GCP/Azure).
I’m expanding my expertise in full-stack software engineering, mobile development using React Native, backend microservices, and mastering system design principles with Python & C++.

Ask me about front-end design (HTML, CSS, JavaScript), web animations, responsive UI, and software engineering concepts.

Fun fact: I turn complex ideas into simple, stunning interfaces — and I believe progress is progress, no matter how small.

Always learning, constantly improving, and open to new challenges and opportunities.
